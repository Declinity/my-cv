            <p className="TNR" style={{"textAlign": "center", "paddingTop": "10px"}}>I originally wasn’t considering taking a placement year, nor was I interested in most offers, as I wanted to finish my degree as soon as possible. My mind changed when I received an email from the university about Cosmient, and how exciting of an opportunity it would be. I’ve known since my first year of university that Artificial Intelligence is the field that I would want to develop my career in, and my interest was further bolstered by a 5-day course I took with Dr. Stephen Lynch.</p>
            <p className="TNR" style={{"textAlign": "center", "paddingTop": "10px"}}>While 5 days is nowhere near sufficient to learn the complexities of AI, I’ve apprehended all the basics like the theoretical aspects behind it and the Python libraries and frameworks behind it. In my own time I’ve examined many of Dr. Lynch’s programs as practice. As per the person specifications, these are the current abilities I have:</p>
            <br />
            <ul style={{"marginLeft": "15px"}}>
                <li className="TNR" >Very good understanding of the Python language, have experience with TensorFlow’s Keras library, and have used numpy and scipy libraries several times. </li>
                <li className="TNR">Experience with manipulating large datasets with the PANDAS library and managing a SQL database. Also used MongoDB in the past.</li>
                <li className="TNR">Able to plot graphs using the matplot.py library.</li>
                <li className="TNR">High versatility for learning programming languages and frameworks. In the space of two years I’ve used Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, C++, C, PHP, Bash Scripting, Solidity, Hardhat, Truffle and React. </li>
            </ul>
            <br ></br>
            <p className="TNR">Out of all the placements offered for the AI foundry, Cosmient is by far the most interesting. It also appears to me as the most intensive, and while I still have a lot to learn it’s not in my nature to back out of any challenge. Due to the complexity of the field I still haven’t had the chance to contribute to an AI-related project, so while this offer would be a big step forward for me I can assure you I am looking forward to collaborate with other team members on such a fascinating and ambitious innovation, and I would give nothing less than my all to contribute to the project.</p>
            <br />
            <p className="TNR">And finally, a big thank you for reading my CV and cover letter.</p>
